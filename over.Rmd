## Project proposal

### Motivation of the project

The motivation of this project is to analyse the geospatial characteristics of Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, selected districts and sub-districts of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara Regencies to determine a suitable site to house the new capital city of Indonesia. This is to reduce the overburden on Jakarta as Indonesiaâ€™s primary hub and the developmental inequality between Java and other islands.

### Project Objective

We aim to recommend a new capital city for Indonesia based on the geospatial characteristics of the location. The following are the criterias that the selected area must meet:

* It should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size
* It should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.
* It should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.
* It should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.
* It should avoid natural forest as much as possible.
* It should avoid areas prone to forest fire.
* It should be highly accessible via road transport.
* It should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).

We will be looking into the following areas:

* Population and Demographic
* Economic and Businesses
* Transport and Communication
* Infrastructure
* Environment and Hazard
