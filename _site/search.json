It has also greatly reduced its poverty rate by more than half since 1999.\r\nHowever, its current capital city, Jakarta, is facing high pollution and traffic congestion, as well as frequent flooding. This city is also sinking fast, hence Indonesia made plans to move their new capital to East Kalimantan.\r\nAbout East Kalimantan\r\nEast Kalimantan is located at the eastern part of Borneo, where its capital city is Samarinda. Its temperature ranges from 21.6 degree Celsius to 35.6 degree Celcius, with high average humidity of 83 to 87 percent.\r\nWe will be looking at these regions for our project:\r\nBalikpapan City\r\nSamarinda City\r\nKutai Kartanegara : Anggana, Loa Janan, Loa Kulu, Marang Kayu, Muara Jawa, Samboja, Sanga Sanga, Sebulu Tenaggarong, Tenggarong Seberang and Muara Badak.\r\nNorth Penajam Paser (Penajam Paser Utara) Regency: Babulu, Penajam, Sepaku and Waru\r\nReferences\r\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/country/indonesia/overview#1\r\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/indonesia-sets-2024-deadline-to-move-its-new-capital-to-borneo\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kalimantan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Layers used\r\n6.1 Criteria\r\nThe following were the criterias to fulfill when choosing the area to house the new city.\r\nIt should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport. It should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\n6.2 Categorise layers\r\nWe grouped these criterias into categories. The categories and what we plan to do with them are:\r\n\r\n7. Clipping of layers\r\nSince the merged layers are not only limited to the study area, there are unnecessary data outside of our study area. Hence, we have to clip them.\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n8. Merging Vector layers\r\nWe merged all the layers of the same category from different areas into one shapefile\r\nOne example of the merged layer, forest is as shown below:\r\n\r\n9. Saving DEM into geopackage\r\nSince we have a large study area, we used 100x100 for this project. We saved DEM into the geopackage, and clipped it to the study area.\r\nWe will get the following DEM as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is to reduce the overburden on Jakarta as Indonesia’s primary hub and the developmental inequality between Java and other islands.\r\nProject Objective\r\nWe aim to recommend a new capital city for Indonesia based on the geospatial characteristics of the location. The following are the criterias that the selected area must meet:\r\nIt should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport.\r\nIt should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\nWe will be looking into the following areas:\r\nPopulation and Demographic\r\nEconomic and Businesses\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nData\r\nThe following datasets were used: \r\nScope of work\r\nThe project will comprise of, but not limited to the followings steps:\r\nSelection of project area, this year the project area is provided.\r\nData collection, extraction, integration, transformation and wrangling.\r\nDesigning and building GIS model and database\r\nPreparing report of survey\r\nPerforming site suitability analysis by integrating GIS and multi-criteria evaluation methods.\r\nPreparing site suitability analysis report including detail discussion of the analysing method used.\r\nPreparing poster and project webpage.\r\nProject schedule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This would help reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub and reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago.\r\nTo reduce Jakarta’s overcrowding, traffic jams, pollution and the need for growth in East Kalimantan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nThe developmental inequality between Java and Kalimantan is concerning as Kalimantan is much larger and with more opportunities than Java but only contributes to 31.49% of the county’s GDP. Java accounts for 8% of the GDP despite being four times smaller.\r\nTo analyse the geospatial characteristics of Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda, selected districts and sub-districts of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara Regencies to determine a suitable site to house the new capital city of Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCriteria used:\r\nShoreline\r\nRiver\r\nFire\r\nRoad\r\nAirport and Seaport\r\nForest\r\nSlope\r\nSettlement\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nUsing AHP analysis as a base to determine the land suitability of the study areas to house the new capital city, and ranking suitability to check against it.\r\nRasterise vector data to create proximity maps for each of the eight criteria\r\nRanking method\r\nRank each of the layer using reclassify by table\r\nAdd all ranks together\r\nAHP method\r\nUse Z Score to standardize the data from proximity maps as they have different scales.\r\nPerform an AHP analysis to determine the relative importance of each characteristic\r\nUsing the weightages from the AHP analysis, multiplying them with the standardized score of respective features using the Raster calculator.\r\nFrom the resulting output, we selected an area with composite factor score>0.3\r\nComparing both methods\r\nWe cross referenced to the results we get from the ranking, and it gave us the same result.\r\n\r\nAHP analysis suggest that the chosen area should be near the western region of East Kalimantan.\r\n\r\nThe rank suitability method also suggests the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Works\r\nTake more layers into consideration such as office buildings, education and government when analyzing the area for urbanism.\r\nRasterize using 30x30 to ensure more accurate results\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nArea selected: Loa Kulu, village of Jongkang in Kutai Kartanegara\r\nWhile the most ideal location identified is located at Loa Kulu, a village of Jongkang in Kutai Kartanegara, it is also closely located in between the two major cities, Balikpapan and Samarinda. Furthermore, it could take advantage of their existing infrastructure despite it being the least important criteria for our AHP analysis.\r\nAlso, based on the site selected, it is easily accessible to roads and there is both airport and seaport nearby. With this, this new site can potentially solve many of Jakarta’s most pressing issues (traffic, pollution, overpopulation, etc).\r\nAs for our most prioritised criteria, fire and shoreline and river, since our AHP analysis received a composite score of 0.3, it indicates that the area is fairly safe from potential disasters and forest fires. Hence, this site is most suitable for the relocation of Indonesia’s new capital city as it meets all criterias listed.\r\n\r\nDone by: Fathima, Harith Oh, Lynn Su\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nhttps://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Population and Demographic\r\n1.1 Distribution of the number of people aged 15 to 55\r\n1.2 Distribution of the number of muslims\r\n1.3 Distribution of the number of people in Other religions\r\n1.4 Distribution of people with education qualifications\r\n1.5 Difference in distribution of males and females\r\n\r\n2. Economic and Business\r\n2.1 Economic and Business In East Kalimantan\r\n2.2 Agricultural Activities in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\n3. Transport and Communication\r\n3.1 Transport in East Kalimantan\r\n3.2 Roads in East Kalimantan\r\n3.3 Signal Towers in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\n4. Infrastructure\r\n4.1 Educational Institutions in East Kalimantan\r\n4.2 Health Services in East Kalimantan\r\n4.3 Water and Irrigation in East Kalimantan\r\n4.4 Electrical Facilities in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\n5. Environment and Hazard\r\n5.1 Shorelines in East Kalimantan\r\n5.2 Distribution of forest and agriculture\r\n5.3 Fire Hotspots in Kalimantan\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Population and Demographic\r\n1.1 Distribution of the number of people aged 15 to 55\r\n Since the working age population in Indonesia is from 15 to 64 years old and the 2021 retirement age is 57, the distribution with people aged from 15 to 55 years old are to be investigated. As observed from the map, it can be seen that most of these people are located in the central parts of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. This might be due to having intensive labour and industries in these areas. Also, it is evident that more people prefer to stay closer to coastlines.\r\n1.2 Distribution of the number of muslims\r\n As shown above, the patterns are very similar to the distribution aged from 15 to 55 years old which shows that a big majority of those age groups are muslims whereby Islam is the main religion for Indonesians. The map also shows that most of these muslims stay in the central parts of Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan which are both near the coastal areas.\r\n1.3 Distribution of the number of people in Other religions\r\n There are not many people with beliefs other than Islam as there are at most 5072 in an area as shown in the map. This includes Christian, Catholic, Hindu, Buddha, Confucianism and Free Thinker. Since the numbers differ largely between Islam and other religions, we are using equal quartiles as a standard method to show the distribution for both maps. The patterns are still similar whereby they are mainly located in Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. In between Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan, there is a large proportion of them staying at Kota Desu.\r\n1.4 Distribution of people with education qualifications\r\n This distribution map includes people who are currently studying in Junior High, high schools and pursuing Diploma in Kalimantan Timur. As shown in the map, these people are mainly located in Kota Balikpapan and Kota Samarinda which are the centralised areas in Kalimantan Timur, having better infrastructure, facilities and resources.\r\n1.5 Difference in distribution of males and females\r\n To look into the gender distribution in Kalimantan Timur, we compare the numbers by (number of males - number of females). Majority of the areas have more males than females at most of 1248 while there are only a handful having more females than males by at most 96. This might indicate that males are preferred for labour especially in infrastructure and heavy industries.\r\n2. Economic and Business\r\n2.1 Economic and Business In East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the businesses in our study area, which include commercial buildings, industry buildings, mines and processed oil industry. Most of the commerce are clustered in the central area, which is in Samarinda. This is followed by the area near the coast, which is in Balikpapan. There are also a few scattered around our study area. With more commercial buildings clustered in an area, we can infer that these areas are more developed than the rest.\r\nFrom the map, we can see that most of the mines are located in Samarinda, most of them away from the cluster of commerce areas. We can consider using these areas as part of our new capital as the area has already been cleared.\r\nIndustries are mostly located at Samarinda and Balikpapan, with an exception, which is located in Tenggarong Seberang. There are 5 oil processing industries in our study area, with three in Balikpapan, and two in Samarinda.\r\n2.2 Agricultural Activities in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the areas of plantation in our study area. No doubt that some agricultural activities are for personal consumption, there are also areas that are for commercial purposes. Larger plantation areas have a higher possibility for having commercial purposes, and we can see that these areas are mostly located at the Kutai Kartanegara regency, which is in the North of our study area. Urban areas would have lesser plantations, hence, we can consider moving to areas with smaller plantations.\r\n3. Transport and Communication\r\n3.1 Transport in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the distribution of transportation, which includes airports, bus terminals and docks. There are a total of two airports, one located on the Northern part of our study area, Samarinda, and the other located near the coast on the Southern part at Balikpapan. Most of the bus terminals and docks are also located near these two airports. Airports and seaports help to provide ease to tourists who are coming into the new capital area. Bus terminals also help to allow greater accessibility for travelling. Hence we can consider having our new capital in areas near these transportation.\r\n3.2 Roads in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the roads in our study area. Most of the areas are well-connected, except for a few spots in Paser Penajam. We would consider having our new capital in areas that are more accessible, which means places where they are well-connected.\r\n3.3 Signal Towers in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the signal tower located in our study area. The biggest cluster is located at Samarinda. There are also multiple signal towers dispersed throughout the study area, except for the area that we are interested in this study in Penjam Pasertara. The greater the cluster of signal towers, we can tell that the place is more urban.\r\n4. Infrastructure\r\nEducational Institutions, health facilities, water and irrigation and electrical facilities will be considered to analyse how advanced a region is.\r\n4.1 Educational Institutions in East Kalimantan\r\n A region’s development is primarily based on its people and its resources. A region with a higher literacy rate will lead to a lower unemployment rate and greater GDP growth. Education is the backbone of any region as it plays a crucial role in technological developments and imparts various skills and values. The map above shows the distribution of educational institutions in East Kalimantan. As seen above, most of the institutions are concentrated in two regions, namely Balikpapan and Samarinda. These are the two most populated regions.\r\n4.2 Health Services in East Kalimantan\r\n The healthier the citizens of a region, the more effective the workforce. It can be inferred from the map above that there are inadequate medical facilities and health facilities in East kalimantan. There are few points in relative to the size. Most of the facilities seem to be situated in Balikpapan and Samarinda. It is likely because they are more populous and developed.\r\n4.3 Water and Irrigation in East Kalimantan\r\n Accessibility water is critical to health, a healthy environment, poverty reduction, a sustainable economy, and peace and security. The map above shows the distribution of drinking water and irrigation in East Kalimantan. There are few irrigation water networks in this area and they are situated mainly in Samarinda and Kutai Kartanegara.\r\n4.4 Electrical Facilities in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the distribution of electrical facilities in East Kalimantan. From the map, we can see the distributions are very uneven. The facilities are mainly located in Kota Samarinda and Kutai Kartanegara. This is likely because Samarinda is the capital city East Kalimantan.\r\n5. Environment and Hazard\r\n5.1 Shorelines in East Kalimantan\r\n The map above shows the coastlines and shorelines in East Kalimantan. Areas in close proximity to this should be avoided, as they are more prone to hurricanes, coastal storms, tsunamis, and landslides, as well as longer-term risks of coastal erosion and sea level rise.\r\n5.2 Distribution of forest and agriculture\r\n The map above shows the forest and agriculture distribution in East Kalimantan. Layers used for this map include: high grasses, bushes, wet forest, non agri shrubs, plantation, paddy fields, irrigation. As seen above, Balikpapan and the South of Kutai Kartanegara is heavily forested.\r\n5.3 Fire Hotspots in Kalimantan\r\n There are several fire hotspots in East Kalimantan. Most of the hotspots coincide with forests. The burning usually peaks during Indonesia’s dry season. The problem has accelerated in recent years as more land has been cleared for expanding plantations for the palm oil trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
