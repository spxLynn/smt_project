This is to reduce the overburden on Jakarta as Indonesiaâ€™s primary hub and the developmental inequality between Java and other islands.\r\nProject Objective\r\nWe aim to recommend a new capital city for Indonesia based on the geospatial characteristics of the location. The following are the criterias that the selected area must meet:\r\nIt should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport.\r\nIt should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\nWe will be looking into the following areas:\r\nPopulation and Demographic\r\nEconomic and Businesses\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nData\r\nThe following datasets were used: \r\nScope of work\r\nThe project will comprise of, but not limited to the followings steps:\r\nSelection of project area, this year the project area is provided.\r\nData collection, extraction, integration, transformation and wrangling.\r\nDesigning and building GIS model and database\r\nPreparing report of survey\r\nPerforming site suitability analysis by integrating GIS and multi-criteria evaluation methods.\r\nPreparing site suitability analysis report including detail discussion of the analysing method used.\r\nPreparing poster and project webpage.\r\nProject schedule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
